## Current Sprint (Week 1)

**Goal**: Get basic detection working and test it on the blog

1. Set up package structure
2. Implement basic `AIPaywall` class with detection mode
3. Create Django adapter for testing
4. Test with minimalwave-blog
5. Iterate based on real data

**Success Criteria**:
- Can detect at least 3 types of AI bots
- Integrates with Django in <5 lines of code
- Logs detection events with useful metadata
- Zero false positives on human traffic
